# Web Page Clone Exercise

As an exercise in creating websites from a provided design, I set out to clone the Services page of iDesign Studios' website (https://www.idesignstudios.com/services/) without looking at the code. I used a Chrome extension to get the font families and font sizes but otherwise relied on simply looking at and interacting with the page. I retained the responsive design of the original, prioritizing mobile layout but including breakpoints at screen widths of 770px and 1024px. In the process, I added a few enhancements to the menu design, particularly with the dropdown menu used in narrower screen widths. These include the addition of some subtle GSAP animations using embeded svg icons. The text of the original has been replaced with AI-generated content.
